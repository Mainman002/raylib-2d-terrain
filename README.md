# raylib-2d-terrain
A simple chipmunk2d physics test where you click to create a terrain path

Dependancies:
* [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)
* [Chipmunk2D Physics](https://chipmunk-physics.net/)

First download the project or open a terminal and type
```
git clone https://github.com/Mainman002/raylib-2d-terrain.git
```

To compile this project you'll need to include the headers from both Raylib and Chipmunk2D
After downloading / setting up a dev environment for both you need to edit the Makefile with the proper changes per OS (I'm using MacOSX here)

Then open a terminal in the extracted project folder and type
```
make
```

There should be a folde named "build", the compiled app image will be in there
